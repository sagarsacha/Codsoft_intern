CodSoft Internship (C++ Programming)

Projects on C++ Programming Internship

Task 1 - I created a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

Task 2 - Simple Calculator : Develop a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.

Task 3 - I build a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other.
